                <p>The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding the iPhone 4S and preceding both the iPhone 5S and 5C. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September
                    12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012. The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance
                    of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the 5S in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016. It
                    had a 4-inch screen, similar to the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, and was released about ten months after Steve Jobs died.</p>

                <p>The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 are estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4S model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34,
                    $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4S. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 cost $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. Mashable noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the
                    iPhone 5 retails for US$649.</p>

                <p>The iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction
                    with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some
                    applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).

                    <p>The iPhone 5 is shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012.</p>

                    <p>The phone can act as a hotspot, sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB, and also accesses the App Store, an online application distribution platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple.</p>

                    <p>The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations.</p>

                    <p>Like the iPhone 4s, the iPhone 5 has Siri, that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands.</p>

                    <p>On the iPhone 5, texting can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.</p>

                    <p>The kernel map is used for kernel allocations of all types (<code>kalloc()</code>, <code>kernel_memory_allocate()</code>, etc.) and spans all of kernel space (<code>0x80000000</code>-<code>0xFFFEFFFF</code>). The kernel based maps
                        are submaps of the <code>kernel_map</code>, for example <code>zone_map</code>, <code>ipc_kernel_map</code>, etc.</p>

                    <p>iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, had been universally derided and lacked many features present
                        in competing maps apps.</p>

                    <p>New privacy settings are available to the user. In addition to location services, the following have been added in iOS 6: photos (already partially restricted in iOS 5), contacts (address book), calendars, reminders, Bluetooth sharing,
                        Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo.</p>

                <p>Apple emphasized the improved build quality of the iPhone 5 at its press event. The frame used in previous versions was redesigned to use an aluminum composite frame.</p>

                <p>The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner, 20% lighter, and has 12% less overall volume than its predecessor, the iPhone 4s. The phone's aluminum body is 0.30 in (7.6 mm) thick.</p>

                <p>The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6. The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz. The iPhone 5's operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled,
                    from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4s; plug-in memory cards are not supported. The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white
                    (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4s had. The iPhone 5 retains the 8 megapixel back camera on the iPhone 4s, but has improved low-light
                    performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app
                    has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at ≤225 hours of standby time and ≤8 hours of talk time.
                    There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions. This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone
                    takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s.</p>

                <p>The iPhone 5 feature a new dock connector named Lightning, which replaces the 30-pin Apple Dock connector. The Apple Lightning connector has eight pins and all signaling is digital. This new connector is smaller than the previous one,
                    helping the iPhone 5 to be slimmer than its predecessors. Apple Lightning cables have duplicate pins on two sides of each plug, so it can be inserted either way round. Various accessories will be available to convert the Apple Lightning
                    connector to the older 30-pin Apple Dock connector or USB, although not all old accessories will work, as not all signals are available, in particular video output and the iPod Out feature for BMW automobiles.</p>

                <p>Earphones known as Apple EarPods are included with the iPhone 5. According to technology commentators, the redesign of the earphones is aimed to improve sound quality by allowing air to travel in and out more freely.</p>

                <p>There are three versions of the iPhone 5, which differ by the frequency used. All three work on 2G GSM/GPRS and 3G UMTS/EDGE networks on both the 800 and 1900 MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800 MHz bands used elsewhere.
                    The CDMA A1429 model works on CDMA networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS band, and the 700 MHz band recovered after the conversion to digital television in the US (channels
                    52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.</p>
